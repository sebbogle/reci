## Technology
### Dotnet Blazor WASM
Reci is built using Dotnet Blazor WebAssembly (WASM), allowing it to run entirely in the browser without the need for server-side components. This ensures that all user data remains local and private.
This choice of technology also enables cross-platform compatibility, making Reci accessible on various devices and operating systems.

### Fluent UI
The user interface of Reci is designed using Fluent UI, a modern design system developed by Microsoft.
Fluent UI provides a consistent and visually appealing experience across different platforms and devices.
